        <h1>Kringla</h1>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar
            <li>1 egg
            <li>2 1/2 cups sour cream
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease or line baking sheets with parchment paper.
            <li>Combine the sugar, beaten egg and sour cream together. Mix in the flour, baking soda and salt. Blend thoroughly.
            <li>Divide dough in half and form each half into a long roll. (Note: If your kitchen is warm, keep the half of dough you're not working with in the refrigerator.)
            <li>Cut off a narrow slice of dough. Roll lightly with hands on lightly floured board into pencil-like strip about 7 inches long. Form into a figure "8", and pinch ends together. Place on cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes.
        </ol>
